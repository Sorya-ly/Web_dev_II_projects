# 🧠 CodeQuiz — Programming Trivia App

A React quiz application testing knowledge across JavaScript, Python, Java, and HTML/CSS, with streak tracking, a performance leaderboard, and full localStorage persistence.

## Features

- **5 pages/views**: Home, Quiz, Results, Performance Board, Profile
- **4 programming languages**: JavaScript (100 Q per difficulty), Python, Java, HTML & CSS (30 Q per difficulty each)
- **3 difficulty levels**: Easy (10 pts), Medium (20 pts), Hard (30 pts) per correct answer
- **Random 10-question quizzes** pulled from each difficulty's question pool every time
- **20-second countdown per question** with animated SVG timer ring
- **Daily streak system**:
  - Playing the day after your last play → streak +1
  - Playing again same day → streak unchanged
  - Missing days → streak resets to 0, restarts at 1 on next play
- **Performance Board**: total score per language, ranked highest to lowest
- **Profile dashboard**: name, best score/total points, performance by difficulty
- **Full localStorage persistence** — name, scores, streak, and history all survive refresh

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- React Router v6 (with dynamic `/quiz/:language/:difficulty` route)
- React Context API for global state
- localStorage for persistence
- Pure CSS, light theme

## Streak Logic (Implementation Detail)

`src/utils/streak.js` exports `computeStreak(lastPlayDate, currentStreak)`:

1. No `lastPlayDate` → first ever play, streak = 1
2. Same calendar day as last play → streak unchanged
3. Exactly 1 day after last play → streak + 1
4. 2+ days gap (missed a day or more) → streak resets, restarts at 1

This runs inside `finishSession()` in the context every time a quiz completes.

## Deployment

**Netlify**: `npm run build`, drag `dist/` to netlify.com/drop, add `public/_redirects` with `/* /index.html 200`.

**Vercel**: push to GitHub, import on vercel.com, build command `npm run build`, output `dist`.
